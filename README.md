This is a text generator program. It runs from the command line. It takes is 4 arguments but the last one is optional. The first argrument is the txt file the user wants the text generated to
be modeled after. The second argument is the seed word. The third argument is the number of words to be generated. If there is no third argument the words generated are the most probable words.
If there is a fourth argument it can either be "all" or "one". If the fourth argument is "all" then the text is gnereated radomly based off the probability of the next word. If the fourth arugment
is "one" then the text is generated deterministically by choosing the next word based off of the word witht the highest probability of occuring.
